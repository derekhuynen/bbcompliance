This one is “Airbnb Plus.”

I did call and speak to a compliance officer but chose not to share the info of the property at the time since I was still in Big Bear and did not feel comfortable doing so until it was resolved. She has since written be a very inappropriate public review in Airbnb sharing info about my disability and job as well as questioning that I work in hospitality. For this reason I am following up with Airbnb and requesting the refund me immediately and remove the review or I will go to the head of public policy at Airbnb.

I found the property on Zillow.  Zillow has the property as a 3 bedroom 2.5 bath and 1296 sq ft.  Another STR owner called her out and she deleted her post.  I check later and she changed it to sleeps 10.  Still to many for 1296 sq ft.

As a responsible STR owner who abides by the City’s rules and regulations this is very upsetting to me.  It’s this type of blatant disregard of the City Ordinances that requires the city to have to step in and make so many restrictions, rules, fines, etc.  

I am requesting that the city immediately look into this matter and fine this owner or, in the alternative, their permit suspended and/or revoked.  

I have attached photos of the Airbnb listing and Zillow of the property.",2500,0
