It’s this type of blatant disregard of the City Ordinances that requires the city to have to step in and make so many restrictions, rules, fines, etc.  \n\nI am requesting that the city immediately look into this matter and fine this owner or, in the alternative, their permit suspended and/or revoked.  \n\nI have attached photos of the Airbnb listing and Zillow of the property.",
