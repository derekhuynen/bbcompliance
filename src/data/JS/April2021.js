Those staying there have said they are renters, but there is no rental signage and this address does not appear in the BBL rental database/listing.  Furthermore there are often 4-6 cars in the driveway and in excess of the 16 person occupancy.  We have overlooked this violation for years, but feel as though it should be brought to the city`s attention given the new urgency ordinance in regards to rentals.  Thank you for looking into this property, their activity and making sure they are following the short term rental rules.",
